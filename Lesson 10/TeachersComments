You forgot about functions. Also, case can be deleted. Instead of it we can use another date function or rename in the most top select.
Correct answer: 
SELECT year, [1],[2], [12]
FROM
(SELECT MONTH(DueDate) as month,OrderQty, Year(DueDate) as year
FROM Production.WorkOrder
) t1
PIVOT
(SUM(OrderQty)
FOR month IN ([12],[1],[2])
) t2
ORDER BY 1
