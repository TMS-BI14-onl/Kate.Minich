There's no such condition as "=NULL". NULL can only be compared with "is NULL".

You've got incorrect result because if select statement and join order.
Correct answer:
SELECT a.Name, a.StandardCost 
FROM Production.Product AS a
LEFT JOIN Production.ProductModel AS b ON a.ProductModelID= b.ProductModelID
WHERE b.Name LIKE 'LL%'

c) -1
Correct answer has only 147 rows.
You literally had everything that you need in the first query.
Correct answer:
SELECT p.Name, COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) as cnt
FROM Production.Product p JOIN sales.SpecialOfferProduct sp ON p.ProductID=sp.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Name
HAVING COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) >1
